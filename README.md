# youtube pomodoro player

a vibe-coded app for listening to youtube & locking-in on tasks that interrupts you when it's time to take a break; sessions currently hardcoded at 20 minutes.

## run locally

- install deps: `npm install`
- run the app: `npm run dev`
- go to `localhost:3000`

## usage

- _optional_: paste youtube url (usually long music mix)
- press "start"; a countdown will play, then a 20-minute pomodoro session begins
- audio cues at 5min & 1min remaining to keep you on track
- when time is up, youtube stops & you're told to go take a break!
