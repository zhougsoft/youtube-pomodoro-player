## usage

Open the app in the browser, paste a YouTube URL (usually a long music mix), press one **Play** button, hear a quick “3‑2‑1” voice countdown, and then a 20‑minute Pomodoro session begins while the video plays. Audio cues at 5 minutes remaining and 1 minute remaining to keep you track; when time is up, a final chime sounds and the video pauses, ready to resume from the same spot for the next session.

- _optional_: paste youtube url (usually long music mix)
- press "start"; a countdown will play, then a 20-minute pomodoro session begins
